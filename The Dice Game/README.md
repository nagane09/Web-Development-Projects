The Above is the Link to the website

I have created a website where based on randome number generation the dice will be shown. If the 1st dice has greater number than the 2nd then "Player 1 is winner" will be displayed and vice versa.

Based on random no generation the dice will also be flipped. I have tride to apply the CSS

I hope you enjoy the Game!!!
